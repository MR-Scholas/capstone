An improved version of SBA-7, using the ffxivcollect API, to create a MERN stack application that displays the API's data on various categories of collectibles. Functionality has been added to create a user account which is stored in a MongoDB database in the backend. Logging in would then allow the user to claim collectibles, adding their IDs to an array in the database which would then allow for a page that displays all of a user's claimed items and the percentage of their collection that has been completed in each category relative to the total number of items in that category within the API.

Currently, it is incomplete and only the login functionality is properly implemented.
